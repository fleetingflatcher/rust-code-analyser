# Text Parser Project

| Unit 1 Capstone | `Rust Code Analyser` |
| --------------- | -------------------- |

## Review

In this Unit, I have covered the basics of 3 main concepts:

1. Data Types
   - All primative types
   - Some more advanced types
   - Some type casting
2. Flow Control
   - Conditional programming (if, match basics)
   - Iterative programming (loop, while, for-in)
   - Function definitions and calling
   - Functions as parameters
3. Code Organization in Rust
   - What is a Module?
   - Modules as files, modules as folders
   - Module definition styles (mod.rs vs new-style)
   - External dependency injection & management

## The Project

In this project, I will apply these concepts to create a rudimentary Rust Code Analyser which can be called on the command line.

### Project Goals

The functions of the analyser will include:

1. Count lines of code.
2. Count comments in code.
3. Count variables.
4. Assess other metrics (number of fns, etc).

After these goals are achieved, the project will be complete.

### Stretch Goals

If the project excites me, I may continue to add features. Some that I would be fascinated to implement are:

1. Estimate static memory usage.
2. Develop internal model of the module-file structure of the project (primed for pretty-printing).
3. Evaluate metrics using this internal model (coupling, circular dependencies, etc).
4. Estimate dynamic memory usage.

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to:

1. Apply the existing concepts from this Unit
2. Learn more about type casting and string processing in Rust
3. Learn how to interact with the OS in Rust to make useful applications
